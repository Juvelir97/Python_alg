Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string 
by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false




class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        k=0
        for i in s:
            if s.count(i) > t.count(i):
                return False
        for i in s:
            if i in t:
                k = t.index(i) +1
                t = t[k:]
            else:
                return False
        return True
